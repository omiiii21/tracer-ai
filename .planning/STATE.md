# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** When a RAG bot misanswers, the operator can open the trace and see exactly which stage failed — retriever returned wrong chunks, LLM ignored the right chunks, corpus was stale, prompt template degraded. Per-step traces with semantic quality metrics turn debugging from guesswork into diagnosis.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Research & Design Artifacts

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Research & Design Artifacts)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All 9 GSD-OPEN-N items have research-backed recommendations ready for ADR drafting (see .planning/research/SUMMARY.md)
- Stack fully locked: Postgres 16 + pgvector (single service for vectors + traces), Voyage AI voyage-code-3, Tremor v3 charts, Tailwind v3 pinned (NOT v4)
- Phase 1 is design-only / no code — verifiable by fresh-agent docs check before proceeding to Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Voyage AI voyage-code-3 pricing not confirmed — check docs.voyageai.com/docs/pricing before finalizing DSGN-01 ADR for GSD-OPEN-3
- Judge calibration set (~30 hand-labeled traces) must be authored in Phase 5 before shipping thresholds
- Tailwind v3 pin is critical: Tremor v3 + shadcn/ui both require v3; do NOT upgrade to v4

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| v2 | Streaming responses (V2-STRM-01) | Deferred | Init |
| v2 | Auth / multi-tenant (V2-AUTH-01, V2-AUTH-02) | Deferred | Init |
| v2 | Cross-encoder reranker (V2-RANK-01) | Deferred | Init |
| v2 | Custom eval dimension UI (V2-EVAL-01, V2-EVAL-02) | Deferred | Init |
